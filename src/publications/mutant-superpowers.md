These are tales of escapism into TV and the X-Men as a metaphor for people with
powerful gifts, believing in ghosts, the comfort of hearing crazy stories, lucid

lowest times of feeling rejected by society for his lifestyle and pursuits,
counseling and mentors, workaholism, medications, and much more exploring the
dark recesses of the mind.
